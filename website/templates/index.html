  						The air quality index (AQI) measures the air pollution level and its impact on human health. It provides information about the quality of air in a specific area and the health effects associated with different levels of pollution. This graph shows the monthly AQI data for all 28 states in India. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancer. It is important to monitor the AQI levels in your area and take necessary precautions to protect your health.

  						A real-time line graph is a graphical representation of data that changes dynamically as new data points are added over time. The graph typically displays data points on the y-axis and time intervals on the x-axis. As new data points are collected, they are plotted on the graph and connected by a line, creating a visualization of how the data is changing over time.
  						<br/><br/>
Real-time line graphs are commonly used in various fields, including finance, science, and engineering, to monitor changes in data over time. For example, a stock trader may use a real-time line graph to track the price of a particular stock over time, while a scientist may use a real-time line graph to monitor changes in temperature or other environmental factors.

  						Mobile tower radio sine waveform with noise refers to the electromagnetic signal emitted by mobile phone towers. This signal contains a high-frequency sine waveform that carries the information being transmitted, such as voice or data. However, due to various factors, such as atmospheric conditions, signal reflections, and interference from other sources, the signal can also contain noise. Noise refers to any unwanted variations or distortions that are introduced into the signal during transmission, which can degrade the quality of the signal and affect the ability to receive and interpret the information being transmitted.
  						<br><br>
  						The level of noise in a mobile tower radio signal can depend on various factors, such as the distance between the tower and the receiver, the frequency of the signal, the terrain and obstacles in the area, and the quality of the equipment used for transmission and reception. To minimize the impact of noise on the signal, various techniques can be employed, such as using higher frequencies, directional antennas, and signal amplifiers. Additionally, signal processing techniques, such as filtering and equalization, can be used to remove noise and improve the quality of the received signal.
