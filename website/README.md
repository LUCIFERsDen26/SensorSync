# Data Visualization Website

### Introduction

- This website serves as a user-friendly interface for visualizing data generated by your ESP8266 device and stored in a MySQL database. It allows you to:

- Access and Explore Data: View the sensor readings and other data points collected by your ESP8266 in a clear and organized manner.

- Interactive Visualization: Interact with charts and graphs to gain insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

- Real-time Updates :  The website display data in real-time as it's generated by your ESP8266.

### Technology Stack

- ####  This project utilizes the following technologies:

    - Python (Backend): Handles data retrieval from the MySQL database, API communication (if applicable), and server-side logic.

    - Flask (Python Framework): Provides a structure for building the web application and handling HTTP requests.
    
    - JavaScript : Enhances user interaction and creates dynamic visualizations with libraries like Chart.js and dynamic website genration.
    
    - HTML/CSS: Defines the layout and styling of the website's user interface.
    
    - MySQL Database: Stores and manages the data collected from your ESP8266 device.

### Detailed File Descriptions

- api.py :
    - This file would define API endpoints that allow frontend code to access and interact with the MySQL database.
    - framework use Flask-restx for building RESTful APIs.
    
- app.py:
    - The core Flask application file factory function inside.
    - Sets up the application configuration, defines routes for different web pages, and handles data retrieval and visualization logic.
    
- models.py:
    - This file defines models based on your MySQL database tables. These models represent the data structures and manage database interactions.
    
- requirements.txt:
    - Lists the necessary Python libraries and their versions required for the project to function correctly.

- static/js/custom.js:
    - Contains custom JavaScript code for handling UI interactions and creating visualizations using libraries like Chart.js.
    
- templates/index.html:
    - Defines the overall page structure, including navigation bars, content sections, and placeholders for dynamically generated data and visualizations.

### Getting Started

1. Prerequisites:

    - Python (3.x): 
        - Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/.)
        
    - MySQL Database: 
        - Set up a MySQL database server in docker container and create the necessary tables to store your ESP8266 data.
        
    - Code Editor/IDE:
        - Choose a code editor or IDE of your preference (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm).

2. Project Setup:

    - Clone or download the project repository.
    - make virtule enviroment ```python -m venev .venv```
    - Install the required Python dependencies using ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

3. app.py:
    
    - flask factory fucntion.
    - register the blueprint.
    
4. Running the Website:

    - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
    - Execute python app.py to start the Flask development server.
    - Access the website in your web browser, typically at ```http://localhost:5000``` (the default development port)
    
5. Interactive Data Visualization:

    - Integrated a JavaScript library  Chart.js into your custom.js file.
    - Fetch data from Flask routes (app.py) using Fetch API calls.
    - Parse the JSON response data and populate Chart.js objects to create visualizations.

6. Real-time Updates:

    - Implement the backend server api's (Flask application) to handle incoming data streams and broadcast updates to connected clients.
    - The frontend updates and dynamically refresh visualizations.
